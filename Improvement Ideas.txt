1.Make sure the new stats have been run through the recursive feature selector 
win loss record
2. Goalies - see if it can be imputed if goalie name appears in a dataset, then count number of appearances
in first x appearances to determine the starting goalie, then one hot encode or maybe even smart replace the goalie's stats as a second step
3. over under performance as measured by imputed neutral odds and money made/lost
4. rolling average of previous 5 - 10 appearances
5. play with SRS
6. compute days rest between games intraseason
7. Try predicting team score rather than logistic winner, also try poisson distribution model
